Welcome to My Music Playlist Django App!


Here, (https://sdtunrdjango.herokuapp.com/), the user is directed to the main page.

On the main page, the user see the artist list. From here, the user can click any of the artists listed, click on 'Songs' to see the playlist, or the user can click the '(+)' to add a new artist to the list. 


When the user clicks on an artist's name, the user is taken to that artist's page where he/she can see the artist name, nationality, a picture of the artist, and some songs by the artist. 

On this same page, the user can edit the artist's name (by clicking 'edit'), add more songs to that artist's page (by clicking '(+)'), and can even delete that artist altogether from the artist list (by clicking 'DELETE').

From the artist's page, the user can also click on one of the songs shown at the bottom to be directed to details about that song. This can also be done by accessing the playlist by clicking "Songs" at the top and clicking a specific song.

When the user clicks on a song, he/she can see details about the song: the name of the song, who made the song, and what album the song is from. The user can edit the song name (by clicking 'edit') and can delete the song from the playlist altogether (by clicking 'DELETE').

When the user clicks on the 'Songs' button, the user will see the playlist. Here, the user can click on any song to see a specific song's details or can click '(+)' to add a new song to the playlist.

To go back to the artist list, the user can click on 'Artists'.
